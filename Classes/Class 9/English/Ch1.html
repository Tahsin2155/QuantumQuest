        <h2>Summary of Chapter</h2>
        <p>The story opens with Margie writing in her diary about an old book that Tommy had found. Margie was reminded of her grandfather who had once talked about his grandfather who went to an actual school where the students were taught by human teachers.</p>

<p>However, Margie and Tommy lived in the future world,in the year 2157 where education was completely computerized. They did not go to school. Instead, they had a special study room where a computer taught them. The computer teacher was programmed and adjusted according to the needs of each child. Now and then the computer teacher-developed faults which were fixed by a County Inspector.</p>

<p>Both Tommy and Margie wondered at the book found by Tommy in his attic. They wondered at it as they read books on the screen of their computer teacher. Margie felt that the computer teacher was boring; she disliked the mechanical teaching and learning. She also wondered how much fun it would be studying in a school. Studying in a fun way, with other children and that too from a human teacher.</p>

        <h2>Summary of Chapter in Hindi </h2>
        <p>कहानी टॉमी को मिली एक पुरानी किताब के बारे में मार्गी द्वारा अपनी डायरी में लिखने के साथ शुरू होती है। मार्गी को अपने दादा की याद आई, जिन्होंने एक बार अपने दादा के बारे में बात की थी, जो एक वास्तविक स्कूल में गए थे जहाँ छात्रों को मानव शिक्षकों द्वारा पढ़ाया जाता था।
हालाँकि, मार्गी और टॉमी भविष्य की दुनिया में रहते थे, वर्ष 2157 में जहाँ शिक्षा पूरी तरह से कंप्यूटराइज्ड थी। वे स्कूल नहीं जाते थे । इसके बजाय, उनके पास एक विशेष अध्ययन कक्ष था जहाँ एक कंप्यूटर उन्हें पढ़ाता था</p>
<p>कंप्यूटर शिक्षक को प्रत्येक बच्चे की आवश्यकताओं के अनुसार क्रमादेशित और समायोजित किया गया था। कभी-कभी कंप्यूटर शिक्षक में दोष आजाता था जो एक काउंटी निरीक्षक द्वारा ठीक किए जाते थे।
टॉमी और मार्गी दोनों आश्चर्यचकित थे इस पुस्तक पे जिसे टॉमी ने अपने घर की कोठरी में पाया था। वे हैरान थे क्यूंकि वे तो अपने कंप्यूटर शिक्षक की स्क्रीन पर किताबें पढ़ते थे ।
मार्गी ने महसूस किया कि कंप्यूटर शिक्षक उबाऊ था; वह मैकेनिकल टीचिंग और लर्निंग को नापसंद करती थी।</p>
<p>उसने यह भी सोचा कि एक स्कूल में पढ़ने में कितना मज़ा आएगा। मज़ेदार तरीके से पढ़ाई, दूसरे बच्चों के साथ मेलजोल और वो भी एक इंसानी टीचर से पढ़ना कितना अलग अनुभव होगा ।</p>
